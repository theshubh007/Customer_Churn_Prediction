# Customer Churn Prediction Model Documentation

Customer attrition, commonly referred to as churn, occurs when customers stop engaging with or purchasing from a company. Churn poses a significant threat to revenue, making it imperative for businesses to understand the reasons behind customer departure and take action to retain them. One effective approach is to use data and machine learning techniques to predict which customers are likely to leave and apply targeted retention strategies. This documentation outlines the steps involved in building a model to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

The goal is to develop a model that identifies customers at risk of leaving, allowing companies to take proactive measures. This documentation outlines the steps taken to prepare, analyze, and build machine learning models to predict customer churn effectively.

## Dataset Overview

The Telco Customer Churn dataset contains customer information, services availed, account tenure, and whether the customer has churned. The dataset features a variety of data types, including numerical and categorical variables. Each record represents an individual customer with the target column, "Churn," indicating whether or not the customer has left.

## Key Features:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Tenure: Duration of the customerâ€™s association with the company
- MonthlyCharges: Amount charged monthly
- TotalCharges: Total charges accrued by the customer
- Contract Type: Type of contract (e.g., Month-to-month, One-year, Two-year)
- Churn: Whether the customer churned (Yes/No)

## Project Workflow

    1. Importing Libraries
    The first step is to import the necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning. These include libraries for handling data, visualizing patterns, and building predictive models.

    2. Loading Dataset
    The Telco Customer Churn dataset is loaded into a structured format suitable for analysis. This dataset contains various customer information, including account details, services used, and whether the customer churned.

    3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    EDA is performed to gain insights into the data. This involves visualizing and summarizing the dataset to understand the distribution of churned customers and identify any relationships between the features and customer churn.

    4. Outliers using IQR Method
    Outliers in numerical features can affect model performance. The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is used to identify and handle outliers in variables such as MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges.

    5. Cleaning and Transforming Data
    Data cleaning is critical for ensuring accuracy. This step involves handling missing values, transforming data types, and ensuring that the dataset is in a suitable format for machine learning models.

    6. One-hot Encoding
    Categorical features such as contract types and payment methods are converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding. This ensures that the machine learning models can interpret these variables.

    7. Rearranging Columns
    Once the data is cleaned and encoded, the columns are rearranged to organize the dataset in a way that is easier to work with during model training and evaluation.

    8. Feature Scaling
    Feature scaling is applied to normalize numerical values. This is important to ensure that no feature dominates the others due to differences in magnitude, which can affect the performance of machine learning models.

    9. Feature Selection
    Feature selection techniques are used to identify the most important variables that influence customer churn. By removing less important features, we can reduce model complexity and improve performance.

    10. Prediction using Logistic Regression
    A Logistic Regression model is trained on the dataset to predict customer churn. This is a linear model commonly used for binary classification problems like churn prediction.

    11. Prediction using Support Vector Classifier
    A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is applied to classify customer churn. This model works well for non-linear decision boundaries and is useful for high-dimensional datasets.

    12. Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
    The Decision Tree Classifier splits the data into decision nodes based on feature importance, helping predict whether a customer will churn. This method is intuitive and works well with both categorical and numerical data.

    13. Prediction using KNN Classifier
    The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is employed to classify churn based on the proximity of similar customers. This instance-based learning technique predicts the likelihood of churn based on the majority class of neighboring customers.
